# Gitlab Runner

Installation of gitlab runner requires [PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) 
and [REGISTRATION_TOKEN](https://gitlab.com/slamdev/catalog/settings/ci_cd) environment variables.

Deployment will automatically register a new runner at gitlab.com and remove the old one if it exists.
